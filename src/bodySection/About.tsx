    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>I'm a React Typescript developer currently in Miami, moving to Atlanta for greater job opportunities.</p>

    <p>On the back end I use Express.js and PostgreSQL. That is my main stack. I also know PHP and Wordpress, and have written a couple small plugins (not featured because I didn't complete the last 20% or so for them to be presentable).</p>

    <p>I'm studying AWS on the side and will probably sit for the CDA (Certified Developer Associate) exam in six to twelve months.</p>

    <p>I like what I do; my portfolio items were built for me. Coding is like grown-up legos without foot pain when you mis-step.</p>
